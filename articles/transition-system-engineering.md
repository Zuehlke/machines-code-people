title: Transitioning Systems Engineering Into The Lean-Agile World
---
# {{page.title}}

*Lean-agile has swept over and transformed software engineering during the last decade. Despite additional hurdles when implementing lean-agile in the systems and product engineering field, the transformational force and the benefits are comparable. Many companies have started to adopt agile practices outside the software engineering discipline. Most are at the beginning or in the midst of the transition. Zühlke is consulting a leading global manufacturer of laboratory equipment and consumables in the transforming the business units and 10 development competence centers worldwide in advancing sustainable profitable growth by implementing a lean-agile innovation process. The following article summarizes experiences and learnings from this agile transition project.*

## On top management level agile is a means not a goal

The customer has been very successful in the past two decades setting quality standards in the industry and growing healthily by geographic expansion. As often success involves complacency and in this case insights into the real needs of different customers and the predictability of project outcome and timeline required improving. Just making the product 10% more accurate or faster didn’t create sufficient customer value anymore. Technical limits of improving product performance had been reached. Cracking them made the products excessively expensive and the development effort unpredictable. Agile with its focus on customer value, early customer feedback cycles and delivering working prototypes in short cadence promises to be a suitable remedy to many weaknesses in the organization. Launching products that excite customers and users with a regular and predictable heartbeat is meant to secure the future growth and success of the company. When transitioning to agile we always have to steer the transformation to those overall goals of our customer.

## For the start, organization beats process: What’s in for me?

The challenges met with have been as diverse as the scope and size of the various competence centers. From writing software applications to complex multi-disciplinary systems and to mainly designing plastics parts to a precision of a few thousandth of a millimeter spans the range of development work performed at each plant. Some R&D competence centers have around a dozen engineers while others employ more than 60 people. At all plants the R&D teams constitute the technical knowledge centers of the plant and besides developing new products they fight obsoles-cence in current products, evaluate and commission new production equipment, support production, suppliers and sales and much more. Agile poses different challenges in such a diverse environment. It needs to be carefully worked out what agile means for each team, how it can be implemented and what the path from the current situation to the agile world looks like. Only when each person involved knows its role in the agile process, is he/she ready to discuss the details of the agile proceeding and methods.

## Stepwise adaptation of agile thinking and methods

As the situation regarding customer insights suggests, few of the pilot projects introducing agile at the customer started with an established set of requirements. They started in an explorative agile mode, where developing the re-quirements, rating customer value and defining a suitable product concept had been the major scope. However, to start the agile cadence with its cycle of sprints an initial product backlog was needed. From that each team worked its own way down to the team/sprint backlog that could drive the first sprints. Now the agile sequence of ceremo-nies was introduced, and the duties and behavior of the roles involved sharpened. After those basics had been adopted, more elaborate practices as the project increment planning are introduced and trained. Once the product positioning and conception is finalized the mode of the project changes to an agile execution further refining re-quirements and design in parallel.

## Simplicity, adaptability and acceptance are key

Agile requirements engineering has proven to be particularly challenging in the diverse environment at the customer. Generally, products and systems exhibit more and wider reaching interdependencies than many software applications. Each engineering discipline has different perceptions how a set of requirements should look like that the engineers can work on during a sprint. Concepts from the software engineering world like features, enabler and stories are not always easy to transfer into the worlds of mechanics and automation. The separation of functional and non-functional requirements provides little additional information or help in designing physical parts. We have therefore ended up with two levels of requirements that every team could translate into its own world and work with for planning and realization:

1. Product Backlog Item: Define the characteristics of the product for customers, users, production, logistics and service; owned by the Product Owner and agreed with all relevant stakeholders before implementation; as a complete set represents the “Lastenheft” of the product.

2. Team/Sprint Backlog Item: Split and detailed requirements and specifications ready for implementation during a sprint; owned by the Subsystem Owner and agreed with all team members; basis for sprint planning and exe-cution; as a complete set represents the “Pflichtenheft” of the subsystem.

That concept has proven to be sufficiently agile to support the agile cadence and adaptable to the needs e.g. of plastics engineering that necessitates a complete set of requirements before finalizing the design and releasing tool making.

## Collaborative product strategy development is a mixed blessing

Many agile pilot projects had been started without an agreed product positioning and vision. Although many engineering and application team members considered it interesting to be involved in such strategic clarification, the ability to contribute differed widely and not everybody could cope well with the degree of uncertainty involved. However, management accepted the low efficiency during the exploration period and regularly innovative approaches and concepts resulted from the collective struggle for better solutions.

## Estimation, velocity and definition of done remain difficult and critical for efficiency

Besides the boost in motivation that follows from the involvement and ownership of team members, the estimation and execution of development tasks in short cadence and undisturbed during a sprint is a main driver for increased performance in agile development. However, gauging team velocity, nailing down estimates and committing to the completion of deliverables remain challenging leadership exercises that need constant attention in a cordial company culture.

## Who’s part of the development team? Who works in cadence?

To focus on project development work, we have postulated that each development team member works at least three full days per week on the project. That has been a daring target for an organization used to working on many projects in parallel. Top management support on this subject helped to continuously improve on this subject and to bring distraction down to a bearable, although constantly disputed level. At least as challenging has been the handling of interfaces to other functions like production, procurement and marketing. In traditional project management those functions are involved as extended team members and their tasks being planned and tracked as part of the Gantt chart. Fully including the representatives of those functions in the agile cadence of the development team is inefficient. Often those functions are intensively involved only during a specific period of the project. We had to establish the awareness that interfaces need to be explicitly managed and that there are shades between being “fully inside” and “fully outside” the project. Some interfaces e.g. launch preparation can run in parallel with the agile cadence of the development team with its own (launch) team and coordinated by the project increment planning and scrum-of-scrum mechanisms. Tool making might be integrated into the development team during the respective sprints. Some interfaces need to be managed specifically by those responsible. We continue to work on establishing practical guidelines for the differentiated handling of interfaces that might be less agile and rely on clearly specified inputs and outputs.
