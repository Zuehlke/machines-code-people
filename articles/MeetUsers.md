# meet with users - often
_Meeting with users, the more the better, is essential to create great products._

Even though I - as a UX professional - must stress the importance of listenting to the users, I still have to admit that the above statement is inaccurate and misleading. With just meeting users nothing is achieved.

Having started with saying that the title of the article I'm writing is, well, rubbish, I need to put up a real big headline to correct this:

## We need to experience what users will do and what they will need and will expect from our products when creating them.

But I don't want to hasten. I should start more slowly and mark the first big issue why we should meet with users:
_We who develop a technical system are not like the users._

This has two notable points:
1. The more we are involved in developing the software the better is our mental model about the system and how the system is meant to be used. Somebody who had little or no involvment in development, has a completely different mental model and will want to do different things.
2. Even in the cases, where we actually are users, we are just some of them. The whole user base of a system has usually many more users and they have completely different needs and mental models than we.

There are a couple of consequences:
1. The needs we identify do not really represent the needs of the whole user base.
2. The features and functions we envision are not the ones the users will really use.
3. The priorities we give are not the priorities that our users will have.
4. How we organize the user interfacae does not match the users' mental models and will not fit the users' tasks.
5. How we design the details will not match the users' expectations.

Or to but it bluntly:
_the more we rely on our evaluation of the product we are creating, the more likely the product is going to suck_

Because we need to understand what really matters and this is a feedback loop:
_The less a development team understands what users need the more the product they create sucks_

By the way, things are bit more interesting. What users really need changes constantly. And it is most vexing for some of us (for others it is a fantastic opportunity) that we who create technical systems are one impportant driver of such change. The simple fact that we introduce new possibilities changes what people are doing, how they are doing it, what they trying to achieve and thus what they expect from the technology we provide. 

So the conundrum to solve is:
_In order to create great products, we have to anticipate what users will need once they adopted the new technology_

And whenever you have an egg and chicken problem, the answer is evolution. So while we are creating and improving our products the stakeholders adapt to what the technology enables for them. 
By the way, people can get quite creative and do stuff nobody every thought of doing wiht our products. If we can harness this creative power our products will rock the market.

So finally, what I really should have said at the beginning is something like the following (many thanks to Bill Buxton): 
_In order to envision the future, we must have lived in it yesterday_
And for living the future yesterday, we must meet with users. 

## Four todos

There are four todos in product development where meeting with users is a must:
* "Understand". It's worthwhile to look at today to understand users and the overall process around the part of the work/life a product is going to support. Look at the small really tough details and constraints of daily life. For this, go to the users to learn from them. This will give key context information and especialy inspire novel products and features.  
* **Story**. Great products really are about the story and this story needs to be sharp. For this, get creative and create simple mock-ups and interactive sketches, let people experience the world of tomorrow and thus learn how this could change users' lives.
* **Concept**. Great products have a sound architecture, also in the User Interface. Create lo-fi prototypes and let users test these prototypes to learn how to best structure the product in the user interface.
* **Details**. Working out the details so everything works smoothly is the daily work of the team. Use lofi or hifi prototyping to do so and test the details before implementing them. Conduct business walkthroughs, pilots, and usability tests in a lab with the product increment to fine-tune the solution.

I put some more details about the four todos (methods to meet with users plus a few things to be aware of) in the appendix.

A word or two of caution: 
* The todos are not a sequence. You will work on all four todos in parallel. You will however experience a shift of focus while your product develops.
* Agile teams are quite often set up as a coding machines where exploring alternatives and fine-tuning a product has little room. You have too make an extra effort.

_If we want to create great products we must create room to explore and fine-tune solutions_

Space to breath is especially worthwhile at these points:
1. Before you start developing: focus on identifying and sharpening the story behind the product (some call it vision).
2. During your first development sprints: focus on setting the major corner stones of the user interface
3. Before implementing a user story: focus on working out the details.
4. After implementing a user story: focus on fine-tuning the product increment.
5. Once you had your first release: expand your team processes to gather and follow up on real-life feedback.

## Who should meet with users?
A few not so successful approaches first:
1. The customer doesn't let us do it, so nobody does it.
2. We assume the customer is doing it for us.
3. We make the customer PO and tell the PO to do it 
4. We take a BA/RE into the team to do it.
5. We hire a designer to make it beautiful before we implement it.
6. We make a usabilty test before we release it.
7. We combine all of them: the BA/RE first creates the requirements, hands them over to the Designers who does the visuals. This is then handed-over to the developrs who implement the stuff and so that the final usabilty test confirms that everything is fine.

All of these approaches have the same drawback: the ones who are actually capable of creating the product have been blind-folded and have little idea for whom the product is, what these people will do with it and how they will experience the product. They can only rely on their own evaluation, which I pointed to be the root of all evil in regards to user experience. Products created that way will most probably suck.

So now to some more promising approaches.

8. Take UX professionals into the team and let them talk to the user. The ones you want in your team care about the four todos and they to it by themselves, if nobody else joins in. They will also communicate as much as they can about users to the other team members. 
Using this option, products definetely suck much less. However, this is likely to create a waterfallish team setup where UX professionals work two iterations in advance, making users happy by gold-plating the specification which is then handed over to developers who - being still at least partially blinded - still do inappropriate decisions.
9. Form an agile team. Forget about job profiles, disciplines and fixed roles. You are one team and focus on creating the best possible solution. Such a team sepearates work by user story rather than by discipline or job profile. This approach is very promising, if you can staff your team accordingly. By the way: its probalbly better to staff the team with members skilled in several discipline and to use specialists very sparingly.
10. Incorporate users into the team. Having a couple of users right in your team to get quick feedback is perfect. Don't forget that these users do not represent the whole user base and you still have to meet with real users. This approach is especially worthwhile when your prodcut supports a very demanding job you will not be able to really grasp or do yourself with a reasonable amount of time. 

## Options on how to get to users
Getting to users can be quite difficult, even though it's necessairy. Here a few ideas (including how not too meet user and still call it user-centric):
1. Simulate and role-play user and do the tasks. Ok, not really users but at least you try to look through users glasses. Good enough for quick and dirty checking whether you actually support the whole process.
2. Replace users with anybody over the hallway. Still not really users but at least people who are not expert on the system and will point out issues you have become blind to.
3. Replace users by people who know the users: Trainers, retailers, support, service engineers and similar. Even though they are not users, they may have good insights about users. 
4. Do informal meetings and use your network to reach users. Easy way of getting access to users for a short session. Obviously needs a network.
5. Hitch-hike on field trips somebody else is doing (e.g. a service engineer, sales people) and use these opportunities to meet with users.
6. Go to a place you are likely to find users and motivate people to talk to you. Works for short sessions. 
7. Go up the hierarchy to request users for session. Works for longer sessions and workshops. However needs time and you must convince the bosses to give you access. This can be quite tough for B2B situations where users are shielded by severl silos: the customer, the local distributor and the global marketing. 
8. Request users into your team for maybe 30 to 50% of their time. Make sure that these users are still doing their job otherwise they quickly unlearn to be users. Prefere competent and expert users over novices.
9. Establish a user pool you can draw upon for session. Be aware that theses users are usually locals and do not represent the whole world. Also you will have a bias to users willing to participate in such a pool. 
10. Use recruiting companies to organize "users" from their pool. Needs a precise profile of whom you are looking for and has a bias towards people that are likely to participate in a pool. 
11. Open up your development to general public and let users join the discussion about what they need, give you feedback etc. using discussion boards, trello, jira, mural, slack, yammer or whatever tools you can provide. This has a bias towards people that are more active and want to get involved. You can use such a platform to let users discuss and synchronize their needs. Easier to setup if you have a product.
12. Create an MvP and gather feedback from your users. Excellent because you can get numbers with some relevance.
13. Install your development team right next to your users so you can just walk over and talk to them. There is no better way. Sadly it is not feasible most of the time.

## A bit of a summary, the thing in a process.
We need three pieces of theory to get to this summary:
1. **UCD cycle** (UCD stands for user-centric design) is the basic iterative principle of meeting with users. Thus learn about users and context, sharpen the story, create solutions, gather feedback. Strive for quick iterations with the most realistic setting for gathering feedback you can achieve.
2. **Level of abstractions** of a product: story, concept and details. When doing a UCD cylce, you will usually work on all three levels. It is however very very helpful if you know, on which level you want to get feedback and then setup your UCD cycle accordingly.
3. **ADM** provides you with a strategy on how to create digital services i.e. (software) products. It distinguishes phases of a discovery, alpha, beta, live and retirement of a product.

Put all these things together, there is a strategy on how to focus your UCD cycles:
* Disovery: focus on the story
* Alpha: focus on the concept
* Beta: focus on working out the details for the first release and start working on the concept for the next releases
* Live: usually, it's mostly details here, but conceptual changes are going to happen quite frequently and you must also expect that the whole story is going to change.
* Retire: focus on details so the transition of the user base to the new product works smoothly.

Here some additional information about 

### Understand: Get inspired by life

Usually, meeting with users starts with life as of today. Go an observe people, talk with them about what they are doing, why, what they love and what they hate. You can also become an apprentice and do it yourself, instructed by a master. Identify their tasks, their values and beliefs, what they try to achieve and what hinders them. 

Methods that help here for meeting with users:
* Contextual inquiry & design, observations
* UX questionnaires and benchmarks
* Empathy maps and response cards

Things to be aware of
* You will learn a lot already from the first session. Avoid doing all the sessions first and then analysing them. Rather steer your progress with a list of open questions, analyse each session immediately and rework your open questions.
* You learn what users do and why. Discussing features and solutions is not the focus of such a session.
* Participants will give you many solutions. Listen and learn what they really wanted to achieve and come up with even better solutions.
* Avoid ticking off questions from a prepared questionnaire.
* You need a wide variety of opinions so pick a wide variety of participants. 
* The gist of the problem lies in the daily hassles. So go and do or talk about real work and real examples. Avoid talking about generalisations. Collect concreate real life stories to drive product development.
* Capture the details as direct quote, collect pictures, materials, forms people are using. These material will allow you to quickly create prototypes that can handle real life problems. 
* You need to consolidate your learnings over several participants: a big wall and sticky notes do the trick.
* Be sensitive to commonalities and differences between the different persons you talked to and work them out. There is no average user.

As a result of such acitivities you can expect to have much deeper knowledge about users, their life, their work and their dreams as well a load of ideas on how to achieve a dream or two. 

### "Story": Evolve the product story

A product story touches at least some of the very fundamental questions of the product definition. I.e. the problem (for whom, what situaions, what impact), the solution (what product and what it replaces), the market (size, revenue-cost-structure, players) and the plan (main features, architecture, migration strategy, team, time and money needed).
Just filling out a lean canvas or creating a storyboard is not enough to evolve the product story. When we do this we must probe the market and get some more substantial evidence. Is the problem relevant? Does the solution fit? Can we create a market?
There are a bunch of more or less complete method frameworks like design thinking, design sprint, user experience sketching, contextual design, lean startup and more. Whatever the name, in the essence, they tell to build a team that iteratively creates and evaluates solutions with users/customers, learn from the feedback about problem, solution and product story.

A few methods to use here for meeting users:
* UX sketches, physical mock-ups and paper prototypes
* Narratives, storyboards
* MvPs and test implementations.
* Hallway testing, UX walkthroughs
* Wizard of Oz testing
* UX questionnaires, metrics and benchmarks
* Empathy Maps, Response Cards
and more.

There are also techniques to co-create solutions together with selected users, making the feedback loop even faster. In a typical participatory session the team chooses one aspect of the solution to discuss with users, creates simple building blocks and lets a group of users work with them. While users discuss how to best solve the aspect, the team listens and observes and gains understanding about the different needs and possible solutions. The team can obviously also propose solutions and by that bring their creativity and design expertise into the workshop. Look for these keywords to find more: Participatory design, co-creation, make space.
This needs an example: To equip a police car, designers created card board models of the equipment to go into the car. They then took and old police car in a police station, their card board models and then asked a couple of police officers to place the equipment so it would really be best. By doing this, they learned a lot about placement options, constraints, real world issues and moments of police life.

Things to be aware of
* Business analysts, market researcher, UX professionals all talk to the users and collect information but with a different focus. They  reach different conclusions and if they do not align well, there will be trouble.
* Really get creative with how you create prototypes and test them. Prototypes should allow to experience the future life with the product and they should be quick and cheap to build. Usually it's a good idea to fake most of the interactive stuff by a person who plays the "computer". 
* Try different variants, your first idea will not be the right.
* Evaluate the solution against relevant problems. Avoid letting users explore a prototype on their own or by artificial tasks. Invest into creating realistic tasks and scenarios. Ideally, users bring their own work and try to do this with your prototype.

While doing this, you can expect that the story gets sharper. You also learn a lot about users, their lives, their work and their dreams. 

### "Concept": Create a product concept.

Once you really start developing the product, you will want to set a few fundamental cornerstones of the solution: information architecture, navigation, layouts and responsive stuff, key elements of the visual design, globalisation approaches, error handling approaches and more. And you want to test this with users.

Methods for meeting with users that help are 
* Scenarios, Visual Scenarios
* Wireframes, Lofi Prototyping
* User/Usability Walkthroughs, Hallway Testing
* UX Questionnaires and Benchmarks
* Empathy Maps, Response Cards
* Participatory Design Workshops, Card Sorting
and more.

Things to be aware of:
* You cannot create a product concept without going into the details of the design. Take a few interesting key examples (key path scenarios) to design for and create the concept based on them. Use additional scenarios to verify.
* If getting to users is cumbersome (it usually is), try the hallway to get a quick first feedback. Just put your drafty sketches on the wall, grab anyone available over the hall and let them give you feedback.
* The first solution is usually not the best solution. So try different approaches. Involve others to point you to new approaches. Try the hallway first to do this.
* Again, realistic tasks or even tasks people brought with them is what you want to evaluate against. 

From these activities you can expect to find the architecture of the user interface of your product. You also will learn a lot about users and about your story.

### "Details": Work out the details and fine-tune your solution

Whenever you need to implement a user story, you will also need to work-out the details on what exactly to do and how this piece fits in the overall product developed so far. So while you are tackling story by story you also define the detailed interactions and visuals. Also in this step, user input is welcome. Therefore again some methods that help meeting with users: 
* Hifi prototyping, Lofi prototyping
* Hallway Testing, User/Usability Walkthrough
* Usability Testing & Usability Lab
* Business Walkthroughs, Pilot Installations
* Life A/B Testing
* UX Questionnaires and Benchmarks
* Empathy Maps, Response Cards
and more

Things to be aware of:
* When working out the details of the story start anew with the real needs and try to find the simple solution. Avoid implementing wireframes a UX professional created alone in his cubicle or a requirments a BA wrote after listening to a stakeholder. Work as a team and dig into the story: what does the user want to achieve in this story and what is the best compromise to do so and what should you therefore build.
* Don't forget to get some feedback. Wireframes, quick interactive prototype are useful here.
* Fine-tuning the product because of a story will also need changing stuff that is already done and ready. Be warend: this needs room the PO did not provide!
* Once you've implemented a bigger story, let users do their work with the story. Provide a test system or even release it so you can measure and get feedback.
* Setup a simple usability lab if you need to optimize specific aspects. Here users can work undisturbed and video recordings allow you to analyse the details of the interaction.
* Not every function has the same importance or difficulty. Test and optimize only what really needs to be optimized.
* Don't let users be the first to test. Take a real life story and play it through. You will find many quirks in your product.

### "Understand": get inspired by life

Ok, I did put that point up already. But don't forget: once your product is up and running and being bought and used, collect and evaluate real feedback. How did life change? What new needs did we create? What opportunities are there for us? So go back to the users and try again to figure out, whether your product needs optimizsation, enhancenemnts, new features or even replacing with yet another product. 

_ It's about inspiration to create the next even greater product while you're competition tries to copy your current product_
